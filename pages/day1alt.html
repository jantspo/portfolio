		<h4 class="text">From Chapter 65: The Whale as a Dish</h4>
		
		<p class="bookQuote">
			<span>T</span>hat mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and, like Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may 	say; this seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and philosophy of it.<br>
			It is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large prices there. Also, that in Henry VIIIth&#39s time, a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of whale. Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating. The meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls. The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them. They had a great porpoise grant from the crown.<br>
			The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all hands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet long, it takes away your appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are not so fastidious. We all know how they live upon whales, and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda, one of their most famous doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly juicy and nourishing. And this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel&#46that these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps are called &#34fritters&#34; which, indeed, they greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives&#39 dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh. They have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off.</p>

		<h3>Section 2: The pointless paragraphs continue.</h3>

		<p class="text">
			This is generic filler text to take up space and help with formatting purposes. It contains no useful information, nor does it contain any book quotes and has no related images to look at. I will include some jokes for your amusement though:<br>
			<br>
			Q: What's louder than a dinosaur?<br>
			A: Two dinosaurs!<br>
			<br>
			That was a good one, wasn't it? How about another? 
			<br>
			<br>
			Q: What did one ocean say to the other?
			<br>
			A: Nothing, it just waved!
			<br>
			<br>
			Yeah, I know, those were bad. But they took up a little space to help add length to what would otherwise be a pretty short page.
